| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The website was not responsive on some devices.                         | Added media queries to ensure the layout adjusts for various screen sizes.                 |
| True/False buttons were overlapping the question on smaller screens.    | Adjusted button sizes and spacing using CSS flexbox and media queries.                     |
| Timer was not resetting properly after restarting the game.             | Added a reset function in JavaScript to ensure the timer starts fresh for each new session.|
| Leaderboard scores were not displaying in the correct order.            | Updated the sorting algorithm to ensure scores are displayed in descending order.          |
| Contact form submission did not provide feedback on unsuccessful sends. | Implemented error handling using EmailJS to notify users of submission errors.             |
| The 404 error page was not styled consistently with the rest of the site. | Applied the same gradient background and font styles as other pages for a cohesive design. |
